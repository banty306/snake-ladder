## General info
So the main motivation for creating this project is that this question is asked in the machine coding code in Flipkart IN.
So there is a bit change as the question was to just print the value of dice in each turn and at last accounce the winner 
but it order to make it look a bit good and easy to understand I just used few symbols to make it look like a real game board.
The link of the question is : https://workat.tech/machine-coding/practice/snake-and-ladder-problem-zgtac9lxwntg
